while I explain. You have already deleted mail from 
dozens of ""Get Rich Quick"" schemes, chain letter 
offers, and LOTS of other absurd scams that promise to 
make you rich overnight with no investment and no work. 
 
My offer isn't one of those. What I'm offering is a  
straightforward computer-based service that you can run 
full-or part-time like a regular business. This service 
runs auto-matically while you sleep, vacation, or work 
a ""regular"" job. It provides a valuable new service for 
businesses in your area. 
 
I'm offering a high-tech, low-maintenance, work-from-
anywhere business that can bring in a nice comfortable 
additional income for your family. I did it for eight 
years. Since I started inviting others to join me, I've 
helped over 4000 do the same."

8,ham,"In my opinion the classifier should still complete and just predict the one class ( all zeros in this case ) and then throw a warning, but it doesn't. It throws the error in stead."
9,ham,TF-IDF Vectorizer creates Tf-IDF values for every word in our text messages. Tf-IDF values are computed in a manner that gives a higher value to words appearing less frequently so that words appearing many times due to English syntax don’t overshadow the less frequent yet more meaningful and interesting terms.
